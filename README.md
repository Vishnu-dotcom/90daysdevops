**DevOps-90days**  


I am following saiyam's roadmap. I will not be following the same order of learning because I have good fundamentals in linux and i am familiar with aws cloud and containers.
I plan to follow the roadmap with the order changed . I would be following a lot of kunal kushwaha (for a basic idea ) and free code camp material.


Roughly the order is 
 -  Networking & git
 -  Cloud (aws)
 -  virtualization and containers
 -  Kubernetes
 -  CI/CD
 -  IAC (Infrastructure as code)
 -  Observability
 -  Chaos engineering
 -  Policy
 -  Service Mesh
